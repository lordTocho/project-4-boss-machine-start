# Boss Machine

## Code Academy example

Working through the CodeAcademy challenge for continue on using the API.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will create an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today's most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. You will create routes to manage your 'minions', your brilliant 'million dollar ideas', and to handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to your busy schedule.

You can view a video demonstration of the final app here:

As you implement functionality, run the tests to ensure you are implementing your routes and middleware correctly. The tests will additionally help you identify edge cases that you may not have anticipated when first writing your routes. You should also test the functionality on the frontend to make sure that things are working as intended. Feel free to add logging middleware to your server, it will help with debugging!
